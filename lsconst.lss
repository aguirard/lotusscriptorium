	@@version 1.0
	@@author Andre Guirard
	Description: Script library to include "lsconst.lss" and not cause an error if it's included multiple times. Use 'Use "lcconst"' instead of '%include "lsconst"' because
		script libraries are only loaded once no matter how many modules include them.

		A few other useful constants are also included.
